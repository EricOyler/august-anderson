<h3>OTTO ANDERSON<br />
Feb. 19, 1891 - Nov. 23, 1955</h3>
<p>Otto (Ott) Anderson came to the United States in 1908. I recall him telling 
he had some money sewn inside his coat and on the way over someone discovered it 
and stole it.</p>
<p>Otto was a natural leader (I always thought he would have made a good army 
officer). He also had a good personality and mixed well with the public. As the 
result of these traits, he always wound up with a supervisor&#39;s job.</p>
<p>He married Henrietta Steel in 1915. Henrietta was barren due to having the 
mumps. According to my dad, this could have been corrected through surgery. They 
chose, however, not to have children until they became financially secure. 
Tomorrow never came. It is my opinion that Otto regretted this in later years 
and substituted with great affection for his nieces and nephews. I recall that 
when I was a &quot;tot&quot;, he would jingle coins in his pocket when they came to visit, 
reach in his pocket and give out money to all.</p>
<p>Otto was an avid hunter and fisherman, these being some of his favorite 
things to do.</p>
<p>I remember his having a &quot;crooked finger&quot; which he told me got caught in a 
horse halter rope. This happened at Andrew&#39;s farm where he stayed when he first 
came over.</p>
<p>He enjoyed smoking Roe-Tan Cigars as well as Lucky Strike Cigarettes. He was 
a heavy smoker.</p>
<p>The following is his work history (some dates may not be exact):</p>
<p>In 1908, he came to this country. The first few years are unknown. Otto 
wrestled in Wichita, Kan. for the Light Heavyweight Division during his early 
years here. He did not win but the match was called a draw.</p>
<ul>
	<li>1912-1920&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page Motor Co., Oklahoma City Shop 
	Supervisor</li>
<li>1921-1934&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Co-owner of A&amp;B Garage, Oklahoma City</li>
	<li>1934-1940&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned farm in Bluejacket (managed by David)</li>
<li>1940-1942&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned farm in Minnesota</li>
	<li>1942-1947&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervisor at Tinker AFB</li>
<li>1947-1950&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned farm in Big Cabin, Okla.</li>
<li>1950-death&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned and operated resort in Grove, Okla.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shortly before Otto&#39;s death in 1955, he knew he was dying of cancer of the 
aorta and was concerned for Henrietta&#39;s welfare. He asked each of the brothers 
to look out for her. Ironically, she out lived all of them and died in a rest 
home in 1989 at the age of 97. Otto and Henrietta are buried in Grove.</p>
