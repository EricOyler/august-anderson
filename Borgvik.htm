<h3>BORGVIK - An idyl on Lake Vanern</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Borgvik-Inn.jpg" alt="Borgvik Inn, Borgvik, Sweden" width="488" height="272" /></p>
<p>The old mill in Borgvik houses the much appreciated inn today.</p>
<p>Because of Borgvik&#39;s strategic location on the fast flowing outlet between 
Lake Varmeln and Borgvik Bay on Lake Vanern, the community became an important 
iron and milling center as early as the 16th century. The iron industry closed 
down in 1924. Today, Borgvik&#39;s main industry is forest products.</p>
<p>The story is told that King Karl XII visited here on his way to Norway and 
became so enamored of Borgvik that he promised to pass through here again on his 
way back to Stockholm. But, unfortunately his plans never materialized as he was 
shot, allegedly, with a button between the shoulderblades by one of his own 
soldiers while in battle against a few outmanned but heroic and peace loving 
Norwegians.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the 20th century, Borgvik blossomed. Industries here at 
that time included a foundry, a Lancanshire forge, a rolling mill, a joinery, a 
woodpulp mill, an electric power station and, not least of all, farming.</p>
<p>Sinterstone buildings, still in use, remain as a memory of that time. 
Sinterstone is the slag left after iron ore is melted in a blast furnace, which 
can be used as a building material. Ore used at Borgvik yielded green hued 
sinterstone and that used in other parts of Sweden produced a blue toned stone.</p>
<p>The lower part of the mill, where the inn is located, was built in 1828. The 
upper half was rebuilt of sinterstone after a fire in 1870. The mill operated 
until 1953. After it was shut down, the old mill was renovated for use as a 
community center that housed a restaurant, theater and cinema, library and hobby 
room, among other things. At the turn of the century, 1,000 people lived in 
Borgvik. Iron from Borgvik had a worldwide reputation and was even used in the 
Eiffel Tower, constructed for the World&#39;s Fair in Paris in 1889.</p>
<p>The death of the iron industries in West Varmland eventually struck Borgvik 
too, and in 1924 the iron mill closed down. Billerud took over the mill in 1920, 
and through the years the Company has renovated the old mill and converted 
Brogvik to a forest industries community. Billerud has striven as far as 
possible to retain the old milling town character of Borgvik.</p>
<p>However, rationalization of the forest industries has caused continuous 
thinning of the population. But because of Borgvik&#39;s propitious proximity to the 
industries on Lake Varnen, and because of its unique character, people have 
become interested in living in Borgvik again. And if plans for new building here 
materialize, perhaps the old milling town spirit can blossom again.</p>
<h4>Three buildings talk of the past</h4>
<p>Three buildings in Borgvik tell of times gone by the estate, from 1690, the 
church, from 1718, and the mill, from the 18th century.</p>
<p>These buildings, together with the remains from the foundry and the iron 
producing era, ensure a place for Borgvik among preserved milling cultures.</p>
<p>The church was dedicated in 1718, and the tower added in 1741. The ceiling 
paintings, signed by Michael Carowsky in 1745, especially complement the 
beautiful interior. Carowsky, born in Danzig, lived in Gothenburg, where he also 
painted in the old Orgryte church. During a renovation in 1880, the paintings 
were painted over, but they were restored to their original beauty in 1949. The 
painting over the altar represents the Holy Trinity and the one on the ceiling 
depicts Christ on Judgement Day, enthroned on a rainbow with six apostles on 
either hand. The paintings on the south side represent Paradise, and Hell is 
painted on a part of the opposite side, in markedly dark colors, a way of 
painting Hell characteristic of the 18th century.</p>
<h4>The mill, or the present Inn</h4>
<p>The foundry ruins remain as a memory from a bygone era. The mill is from the 
18th century and had housed the Inn since 1958. The lower floors are built of 
granite and the upper floors were rebuilt of sinterstone after a fire in 1870. 
Great care has been taken to furnish the mill in a style from earlier times. The 
present local administration, Billerud&#39;s Borgvik forest district, strives to 
preserve the community&#39;s cultural and historical value.</p>
<h4>Excellent camping and swimming</h4>
<p>Borgvik has a first class camping site in connection with the playing field 
and the Sparnas public swimming site on Borgvik Bay.</p>
<h4>A beautiful site</h4>
<p>Borgvik is located 15 kilometers from central Grums. Borgvik Bay is a part of 
Lake Vanern. The outlet for Lake Varmeln flows in Borgvik.</p>
