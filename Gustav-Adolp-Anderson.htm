<h3>GUSTAV ADOLP ANDERSON<br />
Dec. 26, 1904 - Jan. 17, 1981</h3>
<p>Gustav (called Gust, not Gus, by his brothers) came to the United States in 
1922. He was on the same ship with actress Greta Garbo. He was also called by 
his brothers &quot;the power house&quot;. He had amazing brute strength. He would close a 
big machinist vise down and then bend the handle. I can remember at family 
gatherings he would playfully grab one of the brother&#39;s knees in his viselock 
hand and they would start to dance.</p>
<p>Gustav was an excellent machinist, having learned this trade from his 
father-in-law, Johnny Johnson. He could make almost anything on a lathe to 
perfection. He was also an excellent mechanic. As a young man, he played the 
accordion. He laughed a lot and was fun loving and somewhat &quot;ornery.&quot;</p>
<p>Gustav had a dry sense of humor and said several things which the family 
laughed over for years. Here are a few: A salesman came to the A&amp;B Garage and 
tried to sell Gust something as he was working away on a car. The salesman asked 
if he was interested and he replied, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t even think about it!&quot;</p>
<p>Another event in the A&amp;B Garage happened when he had difficulty trying to 
start a customer&#39;s car. Otto asked him if he had tried to crank it. He replied, 
&quot;I cranked it till I boiled the water in the radiator.&quot; He once described a lady 
he had talked to who had loose dentures, as sounding like a typewriter. In 1960, 
he had a heart attack and had stopped smoking. I asked how he was doing and he 
said, &quot;I would like to have a cigarette at least 3 feet long.&quot;</p>
<p>Gustav and Otto were naturalized in this country under the family name of 
Anderson. All of the others were naturalized under the name of Borgstrom which 
was bestowed upon them by the priest of the Lutheran Church after they completed 
their confirmation class. Anderson was a very common name so the priest changed 
their names to Borgstrom. The immigration authorities gave them their choice of 
keeping the name Borgstrom or going back to the family name of Anderson.</p>
<p>Gustav married Kathie Johnson, who was ½ Swedish and ½ German, in September 
1928. They had two children: Frances (Kathie) and Robert.</p>
<p>Gustav, Erik and Otto remained close to each other in geographical area 
throughout their lives. For much of their lives, they did not stay in one place 
long.</p>
<p>The following is a list of Gustav&#39;s work history and area where he lived (the 
dates may not be exact):</p>
<ul>
	<li>1920&#39;s-1933&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&amp;B Garage, 
	Oklahoma City mechanic</li>
<li>1933-1934&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Houston machinist</li>
	<li>1935-1936&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Tacoma, Wash. machinist</li>
<li>1937-1941&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welch, 
Okla. mechanic</li>
	<li>1942-1943&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Chicago tool and die maker</li>
<li>1944-1945&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned 
farm Minnesota</li>
	<li>1945-1947&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Tinker AFB machinist</li>
<li>1948-1950&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned 
farm, Big Cabin</li>
<li>1951-retirement&nbsp;&nbsp; Pryor machinist, John Deere</li>
</ul>
<p>It appeared to me that Gustav, Erik and Otto in the earlier years of their 
lives were searching for something which they didn&#39;t find until the last few 
years of their lives.<br />
Gustav died of a heart attack on Jan. 17, 1981 and is buried in Pryor, Okla.</p>
