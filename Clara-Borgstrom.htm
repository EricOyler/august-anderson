<h3>CLARA BORGSTROM<br />
April 27, 1894 - Jan. 6, 1982</h3>
<p>Clara came to the United States in 1910. She was loved by everyone. She was 
always jolly, a very positive thinker, seemed more broad minded than some of the 
others and had the accent. I remember one of her expressions upon being 
surprised was &quot;oh, de dickens.&quot;</p>
<p>Clara&#39;s first husband was Rupert Wilkerson who made electrical signs and 
lights. He was an electrical genius. Dad used to tell about him &quot;hot wiring&quot; his 
work bench and sending him over to pick up a tool for him. They first lived in 
Oklahoma City and then moved to Denver, Colo. Rupert was a very talented likable 
man, so all that knew him said, but had one problem, he was a thief, which no 
one knew. As the story goes, he was working on some light in a Catholic church 
in Denver and put gum on the locks of the church when he left that afternoon. 
That night he returned and stole gallons of Communion wine (this was during 
Prohibition). The authorities went to his shop at home recovered the wine and 
found numerous other &quot;hot items.&quot; He was imprisoned and then broke out of jail. 
Needless to say, Rupert was not discussed in family circles.</p>
<p>Clara and Rupert had one son named Floyd (Buster) Wilkerson.</p>
<p>Clara divorced Rupert and went to work as a cook for a family in Denver. This 
family (name unknown) was very much into the money. So much so, that they 
sponsored, either in part or completely, the flight of Charles Lindberg. 
Lindberg came to the family home and was met by Clara and Buster.</p>
<p>Clara later married an immigrant from Finland, Victor Holm, who came to the 
United States in 1904. Vic was a lead miner and he and Clara made their home in 
Denver until 1966. They moved to Oceanside, Calif. after Vic&#39;s retirement. Clara 
was an asthmatic and was on medication constantly in Denver. After moving to 
California, she no longer required medication.</p>
<p>From all reports, Clara and Victor had a happy marriage. Victor died in 1968 
of an apparent heart attack. I never saw him. </p>
<p>Clara then married Mike Billet, whom I met after their marriage in 1970. Mike 
died in</p>
<p>Clara was the last of the living children. She died in Oceanside, Calif. on 
Jan. 1982 and is buried there.</p>

<h3>CLIPPING FROM OKLA CITY PAPER 1920</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Newspaper-clipping.jpg" width="173" height="183" alt="Clipping from Oklahoma City in 1920" /></p>
<p>You will note this clipping mentions Mrs. R. G. Seymore. Rupert Wilkerson 
married Clara under the false name of Rupert Seymore. It was some time later 
when she learned the truth and involved quite an amount of legal action to get 
this straightened out.</p>
<p>It is also interesting that when Clara and Otto first came to America they 
stayed at Andrews for a period of time. Clara became quite interested in a young 
man named Koons. Big brother Otto did not like Koons and ran him off. There was 
hard feelings between Clara and Otto over this. Otto on the other hand, became 
quite fond of Rupert and strongly encouraged this relationship Could it be he 
ran the wrong one off?</p>
