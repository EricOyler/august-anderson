<h3>DAVID HAROLD BORGSTROM<br />
Feb. 9, 1906 - March 29, 1981</h3>
<p>David (Dav, as his brothers called him) came to the United States in October 
of 1923. I recall him telling about going to the delicatessen upon his arrival 
here. He would pick up food in one hand and extend the other hand out with coins 
in it, trusting that people would make correct change. He first went to 
Lindsborg, Kan. and stayed and worked with Andrew, the oldest of the boys.</p>
<p>He once told me that he and Andrew were &quot;batching&quot; in Colorado. They leased 
800 acres in Byers, Colo. from 1923 until 1927. Andrew made a raisin pie but did 
not put any filling in it. He laughed and said it was like B.B.&#39;s.</p>
<p>David was not a big man but like my dad, he was built &quot;like a gorilla.&quot; I 
visited him on his farm in Minnesota in 1950. For fun, he would take the crank 
of his Fordson tractor, spin in and lift the front wheels of the tractoroff the 
ground amazing!</p>
<p>David worked as a mechanic in the A&amp;B Garage from 1927 until 1933. He then 
worked in Austin, Texas with Gustav and Johnny Johnson in a machine shop for a 
year or so. In 1934, he and his family moved to Bluejacket where he operated a 
farm. In 1940, he moved to Taylor Falls, Minn. where he owned and operated a 
dairy. He remained there until 1977. He then moved to Grove, Okla. to look after 
Henrietta, Otto&#39;s widow, until his death in 1981.</p>
<p>David married Leona Steele on Sept. 15, 1930. They had two sons: Carl and 
Kenneth.</p>
<p>David was like my dad in many ways including appearance. He became a father 
substitute for my two brothers and me.</p>
<p>As a younger man he had a violent temper but this mellowed through the years. 
He was fun loving, laughed a lot and was a positive thinker. He was extremely 
hard working. He was easy to get acquainted with and easy to become attached to. 
He always had a twinkle in his eye. People liked to be around him. He spoke with 
a heavy accent and was very liberal in his thinking.</p>
<p>David died of a heart attack on March 29, 1981 and is buried in Grove, Okla.</p>
<p>David&#39;s wife, Leona, is living in Taylor Falls, Minn.</p>
<p>Dates furnished by Carl Borgstrom, son of David, Pryor, Okla.</p>
