<h3>JOHN AUGUST BORGSTOM<br />
SEP. 19, 1866 - JUNE 7, 1957</h3>
<p>John Borgstrom came to America in 1897. He first worked in a Blacksmith shop 
in Kansas and then moved to Elk City, Okla. where he met and married Jessie 
Miller (my Mother&#39;s sister in 1903).<br />
He then moved to Oklahoma City in 1906 and continued as a blacksmith for several 
years.</p>
<p>In the early teens he worked as a mechanic with Otto for Page Motor Co.</p>
<p>In 1920, John and Jessie, Otto and Henrietta, Clara and her son Buster and my 
dad returned to Sweden for a visit.</p>
<p>John had a lot of heartache in his life. He and Jessie lost a daughter, Ilda, 
to diphtheria in 1907. Ilda was 1 ½ yrs. old. Also, in the 20&#39;s John developed a 
hip condition and started taking steam baths to help the condition. He went to a 
steam bath and the owner forgot him and left the building. John was hospitalized 
for months and it left him with a stiff hip. In 1930, his wife Jessie had a 
stroke and died.</p>
<p>John and Jessie had four surviving daughters: Charlotte, Alma, Gertrude and 
Flossie.</p>
<p>John was an excellent blacksmith, metal temperer and carpenter and could 
devise almost anything.</p>
<p>John was a very devout Christian. He was the only one of the brothers who 
used no form of tobacco and never would you hear him use any form of curse 
words. I always felt he and my mother were very instrumental in influencing my 
dad.</p>
<p>John invented many things in his life, yet never applied for a patent. Had 
he, there is no doubt in my mind he would have become a very wealthy man. One of 
the things he invented was the locks used on Fruehoff trailers today. There were 
numerous other things such a special tools, etc. All one needed to do was tell 
him what was needed and the &quot;cogs started clicking.&quot; He was quite a remarkable 
man.</p>
<p>When I was a boy, 10 or 12 years of age, he made me a machine gun from a 
block of wood. It had wooden bullets and would shoot across the room some 12 
feet or more. I treasured this but I don&#39;t know what happened to it through the 
years.</p>
<p>In the early 1940&#39;s, he lost his right thumb and first finger on a table saw. 
I remember it well but I don&#39;t know the exact details.</p>
<p>He was employed by the A &amp; B Garage and straightened car frames, did body 
work and made special tools.</p>
<p>After the closing of the A &amp; B Garage, he worked for a commercial trailer 
manufacturing Co. in Oklahoma City building the insulated trailer until his 
retirement.</p>
<p>He had great ingenuity. His right leg and hip were stiff and when he drove a 
car, this leg extended over into the passenger side. He devised an accelerator 
linkage on his 1936 Dodge where he could operate it with his stiff leg.</p>

<p>He could also clutch and brake with his left foot.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/clutch-brake.jpg" width="311" height="75" alt="clutch and brake invention by John" /></p>
<p>He also developed a gadget to tie his show on the right foot. He got the idea 
from bundle knoters on grain binders.<br />
John remarried a lady named Ida in 1936 - everyone feels this was a mistake. 
They never got along. John died of a heart attack in 1957, his wife Ida left 
Oklahoma City and no one ever heard from her again. John is buried in Elk City, 
Okla.</p>
