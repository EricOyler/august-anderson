<h3>ANDREW BORGSTROM<br />
APRIL 29, 1873 - FEB 24, 1960</h3>
<p>Andrew, the oldest of the children, came to America in 1893. </p>
<p>Andrew was not a wanderer. He settled almost immediately in the Lindsborg, 
Kan. area, farmed, raised a family, and blacksmith till his death. </p>
<p>He married Hilda Hoglund on Jan 1, 1902. Hilda was born Dec. 9 1880 in 
McPherson County Kansas. She was also full-blood Swedish. To them in the 
following order were born six children: Myrtle, Walter, Mable, Mildred, Bernice 
&amp; Lea.</p>
<p>Andrew was a father figure to the rest of his brothers. Some of them stayed 
with him and Hilda when they first arrived in the United States.</p>
<p>My mother and father spent their honeymoon at Andrew&#39;s farm in Lindsborg. I 
am told Otto and Henrietta died also.</p>
<p>I was 17 the first time I saw Andrew. He and I, my dad and John played pitch 
at John&#39;s house how he loved to play. I got tickled about his &quot;Yacks and Yokers.&quot;</p>
<p>Andrew used snuff which he referred to as &quot;SNUZE&quot; (I supposed the 
pronunciation in Sweden- I vividly remember that.)</p>
<p>Andrew, like John, was an excellent blacksmith, and watching him work you 
could really tell he enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Lindsborg, Kan. is called &quot;Little Sweden.&quot; Hilda and Andrew spoke Swedish 
with the home. I am told the children did not learn to speak English until they 
started to school.<br />
Andrew was a very strict disciplinarian (as was my dad). All that was necessary 
was a look to his children. He was also fun loving and played the accordion for 
local dances.</p>
<p>Dates furnished by Marge Shogren, Lindsborg, Kan. granddaughter of Andrew.</p>

	Dec. 9, 1880, in McPherson County and passed away at the Lindsborg Hospital, 
	Februayr 14, 1961 at the age of 80 years, 2 months and 5 days.</p>
	<p>She was married to Andrew Borgstrom Janurary 1, 1902. He preceded her in

	<p>One sister, Mrs. August L. Johnson, Linsborg, Kansas; 15 grandchildren, 
	12 great grandchildren and many relatives and friends.</p>
	<p>Although she was in failing health for several years her condition was 
	not considered critical until the last few months.</p>
	<p>She had a great love for her home and family and was happiest when 
	surrounded by her children and grandchildren. She will be sadly missed by 
	all who knew and loved her.</p>
	<p>It can be said, &quot;Not the end but the beginning of a life time of 
	beautiful memories.</p>

	<p>Mr. Andrew Borgstrom, eldest son of Johanna and August Anderson, was born

	sisters, four brothers; 14 grandchildren; 11 great grandchildren, and many 
	relatives and friends.</p>
	<p>Mr. Borgstrom possessed a jovial nature and was loved by his family and

	during his lengthy illness.</p>
	<p>It can be said-&quot;Not the end, but the beginning of a life time of 
	beautiful memories.&quot;</p></div>
