<h1>The Children of August Anderson</h1>
<h3>by Cliff Borgstrom</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>DEDICATION</h3>
<p>This publication is dedicated to the memory of my father, Hjalmar Borgstrom, 
who I loved and admired greatly; to my son Mike and daughter Nancy, so they 
might better understand their heritage; to my grandparents, whom I never knew 
and to my aunts and uncles, whom I thought were the strongest, wisest, and most 
determined people I ever knew. This was true. I also thought of them as being 
immortal. This was not true. Their feet were made of clay as are all people and 
with the passing of time, they have gone on to another dimension as shall we 
all.<br />
Cliff Borgstrom<br />
Author<br />
June 19, 1990</p>
<h3>FORWARD BY AUTHOR</h3>
<p>I have attempted to describe and give a history of the Anderson/Borgstrom 
family. I personally knew each of them except Carl and those who remained in 
Sweden. Much of the history is based on events I remember growing up, much upon 
questions I asked my dad, some (in Sweden) supplied by Sven-Erik, the son of 
Tilda. There are some opinions which the author has given in regard to family 
members. These opinions I believe to be true on what I have observed and they 
are in no way intended to &quot;belittle anyone.&quot; These opinions are presented to 
help future generations understand the type of people our ancestors really were. 
I loved them all.</p>
<p>First of all, I&#39;ll try to answer a question that many of you will be 
wondering about. One of the first questions I asked my dad was, &quot;Why did you 
leave your home and come to this country?&quot; During the late 1800&#39;s and early 
1900&#39;s, Sweden was completely Socialistic. The government owned the farms, 
factories, etc. My grandfather worked on a farm until he was 75. At age 75, he 
was allowed to retire and was given a small house to live in, a garden spot to 
grow food and a cow to milk. There was no future for a working man.</p>
<p>Most of the boys were 17 when they came to this country, mere kids. They 
could not speak English and they had very little money. They did not know if 
they would ever see their parents or their homeland again. They were not short 
on &quot;guts.&quot; I know I could not have done this.</p>
<p>Now, lets look at history from the time they landed here until the time they 
departed from this earth.</p>
<ol>
	<li>World War I, in which my Dad served.</li>
	<li>The Great Depression which wiped out the flourishing business owned by 
	Hjalmar and Otto. The loss of jobs by employees David, Erik, Gustav and 
	John.</li>
	<li>The 12 years which followed the 1929 crash when people worked from sunup 
	to sundown trying to make enough money to feed a family.</li>
	<li>World War II, which affected their lives either directly or indirectly.</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;Stress Tabs&quot; were not on the market in those days. There were also other 
dilemmas suffered by the individual brothers and sisters which will be brought 
out in the following pages. It is amazing to me that they lived as long as they 
did with all that they went through. There is one thing for certain, they were 
all very strong-willed people.</p>
<p>Through the 30&#39;s, 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s, there were many Sundays and holidays when 
all the children except Carl, Clara and Andrew were together at our house. They 
had such a great time together. Each and everyone of them had an &quot;energy 
streak.&quot; They would pull pranks on one another and I can still hear the ring of 
their &quot;belly laughs.&quot; What a joy it was to be around them at those gatherings. I 
remember that if they wanted to discuss something which was a little &quot;tinted&quot;, 
they spoke in Swedish, so that wives and children did not comprehend. Erik and 
Gustav particularly would laugh themselves into a &quot;frenzy.&quot; I have such great 
memories of those gatherings.</p>
<p>All of the boys, though different in some ways, possessed these traits: they 
were all very honest, they would give you the shirt off the back if you had a 
need, they were hard workers (did not have much use for anyone who wasn&#39;t) and 
they were devoted family men.</p>
<h3>WHAT&#39;S IN A NAME?</h3>
<p>It was a common practice in Sweden to &quot;affix a son&quot; to the first name of the 
father to become the last name of the son, i.e. the son of John became Johnson, 
the son of Peter became Peterson and so on. However, it is not that simple 
because some first names are not used in this manner. Also, there is an 
abundance of Andersons, Johnsons, Johansons, Petersons, etc. and the children 
are given all together different names, i.e. Borgstrom.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the children of Otto and Alma Nystrom retained 
the name Nystrom.</p>
<p>From what I have been able to research (and I&#39;m not 100% sure on this) but 
the girls, Clara, Anna, Alma and Tilda, retained the name of Anderson. I suppose 
they figure it will be changed by marriage anyway.</p>
<p>It is interesting and it is most confusing.</p>
<p>Sven-Erik Svartmark, the son of August and Tilda Johanson, told me he wanted 
them to give him the name Borgstrom, but they refused.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Map-of-Sweden.jpg" alt="Map of Sweden" width="542" height="759" /><br />
The children of AUGUST ANDERSON were born and raised in BORGVIK, SWEDEN in the 
province of VARMLAND.</p>

torn down in 1932.</p>
<h3>BORGVIK - An idyl on Lake Vanern</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Borgvik-Inn.jpg" alt="Borgvik Inn, Borgvik, Sweden" width="488" height="272" /></p>
<p>The old mill in Borgvik houses the much appreciated inn today.</p>
<p>Because of Borgvik&#39;s strategic location on the fast flowing outlet between 
Lake Varmeln and Borgvik Bay on Lake Vanern, the community became an important 
iron and milling center as early as the 16th century. The iron industry closed 
down in 1924. Today, Borgvik&#39;s main industry is forest products.</p>
<p>The story is told that King Karl XII visited here on his way to Norway and 
became so enamored of Borgvik that he promised to pass through here again on his 
way back to Stockholm. But, unfortunately his plans never materialized as he was 
shot, allegedly, with a button between the shoulderblades by one of his own 
soldiers while in battle against a few outmanned but heroic and peace loving 
Norwegians.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the 20th century, Borgvik blossomed. Industries here at 
that time included a foundry, a Lancanshire forge, a rolling mill, a joinery, a 
woodpulp mill, an electric power station and, not least of all, farming.</p>
<p>Sinterstone buildings, still in use, remain as a memory of that time. 
Sinterstone is the slag left after iron ore is melted in a blast furnace, which 
can be used as a building material. Ore used at Borgvik yielded green hued 
sinterstone and that used in other parts of Sweden produced a blue toned stone.</p>
<p>The lower part of the mill, where the inn is located, was built in 1828. The 
upper half was rebuilt of sinterstone after a fire in 1870. The mill operated 
until 1953. After it was shut down, the old mill was renovated for use as a 
community center that housed a restaurant, theater and cinema, library and hobby 
room, among other things. At the turn of the century, 1,000 people lived in 
Borgvik. Iron from Borgvik had a worldwide reputation and was even used in the 
Eiffel Tower, constructed for the World&#39;s Fair in Paris in 1889.</p>
<p>The death of the iron industries in West Varmland eventually struck Borgvik 
too, and in 1924 the iron mill closed down. Billerud took over the mill in 1920, 
and through the years the Company has renovated the old mill and converted 
Brogvik to a forest industries community. Billerud has striven as far as 
possible to retain the old milling town character of Borgvik.</p>
<p>However, rationalization of the forest industries has caused continuous 
thinning of the population. But because of Borgvik&#39;s propitious proximity to the 
industries on Lake Varnen, and because of its unique character, people have 
become interested in living in Borgvik again. And if plans for new building here 
materialize, perhaps the old milling town spirit can blossom again.</p>
<h4>Three buildings talk of the past</h4>
<p>Three buildings in Borgvik tell of times gone by the estate, from 1690, the 
church, from 1718, and the mill, from the 18th century.</p>
<p>These buildings, together with the remains from the foundry and the iron 
producing era, ensure a place for Borgvik among preserved milling cultures.</p>
<p>The church was dedicated in 1718, and the tower added in 1741. The ceiling 
paintings, signed by Michael Carowsky in 1745, especially complement the 
beautiful interior. Carowsky, born in Danzig, lived in Gothenburg, where he also 
painted in the old Orgryte church. During a renovation in 1880, the paintings 
were painted over, but they were restored to their original beauty in 1949. The 
painting over the altar represents the Holy Trinity and the one on the ceiling 
depicts Christ on Judgement Day, enthroned on a rainbow with six apostles on 
either hand. The paintings on the south side represent Paradise, and Hell is 
painted on a part of the opposite side, in markedly dark colors, a way of 
painting Hell characteristic of the 18th century.</p>
<h4>The mill, or the present Inn</h4>
<p>The foundry ruins remain as a memory from a bygone era. The mill is from the 
18th century and had housed the Inn since 1958. The lower floors are built of 
granite and the upper floors were rebuilt of sinterstone after a fire in 1870. 
Great care has been taken to furnish the mill in a style from earlier times. The 
present local administration, Billerud&#39;s Borgvik forest district, strives to 
preserve the community&#39;s cultural and historical value.</p>
<h4>Excellent camping and swimming</h4>
<p>Borgvik has a first class camping site in connection with the playing field 
and the Sparnas public swimming site on Borgvik Bay.</p>
<h4>A beautiful site</h4>
<p>Borgvik is located 15 kilometers from central Grums. Borgvik Bay is a part of 
Lake Vanern. The outlet for Lake Varmeln flows in Borgvik.</p>
<h3>AUGUST ANDERSON<br />
Aug. 6, 1845 Jan. 22, 1940</h3>
<p>The following description of my grandfather is based upon things my father 
told me and facts related by Sven-Erik who looked after him during the latter 
years of his life.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that August was a very strong person to have lived as 
long as he did. In 1920, Henrietta and Jessie went for a walk with him on their 
trip to Sweden (he was nearly 75 at the time). They stated they could not &quot;keep 
up with him.&quot;</p>
<p>He was a religious man of the Swedish Lutheran Faith. August was a farmer all 
his life working for the government co-operative farm.</p>
<p>My dad smoked a pipe and kept a piece of charcoal in the bottom of it. He 
said that kept down the moisture and made a cooler smoke. He learned this from 
his dad.</p>
<p>Dad said that grandfather told him as a boy, if you are going to drink 
&quot;booze&quot; make sure you drink enough to &quot;throw-up&quot;, so your body doesn&#39;t absorb 
it. I believe he was teaching a double lesson here.</p>
<p>On Aug. 6, 1872, August married Johanna Oldsetter born July 20, 1850. August 
and Johanna had three sons: Andrew, Karl and John. Johanna died Aug. 15, 1882 at 
the age of 32. The case of her death is unknown.</p>
<p>August then married Charlotte Anderson, born April 21, 1859, on Nov. 17, 
1883. To them, the following children were born in this order: Matilda, Alma, 
Anna, Otto, Clara, Hjalmar, Erik, Gustav and David.</p>
<p>August raised his family in the small village of Borgvik in Varmland 
Province, located in southern Sweden. I have often thought, if only two of these 
children remained in Sweden, how terribly only August and Charlotte must have 
been.</p>
<p>Matilda looked after August and Charlotte during the latter years of their 
lives and corresponded with the boys in America.</p>
<p>Sven-Erik told me that August became senile toward the end of his life and 
they had to watch him closely. On one particulate evening, they had to leave him 
alone. It was terribly cold and he wandered out, fell back in a snow drift, and 
couldn&#39;t get up. I do not know how long he lay there but when they found him his 
legs and arms were frozen. He lived about a week after that and died Jan 22, 
1940.</p>
<p>Charlotte died in April 1942.</p>

<h2>THE CHILDREN OF<br />
AUGUST AND JOHANNA ANDERSON</h2>
<h3>ANDREW BORGSTROM<br />
APRIL 29, 1873 FEB 24, 1960</h3>
<p>Andrew, the oldest of the children, came to America in 1893. </p>
<p>Andrew was not a wanderer. He settled almost immediately in the Lindsborg, 
Kan. area, farmed, raised a family, and blacksmith till his death. </p>
<p>He married Hilda Hoglund on Jan 1, 1902. Hilda was born Dec. 9 1880 in 
McPherson County Kansas. She was also full-blood Swedish. To them in the 
following order were born six children: Myrtle, Walter, Mable, Mildred, Bernice 
&amp; Lea.</p>
<p>Andrew was a father figure to the rest of his brothers. Some of them stayed 
with him and Hilda when they first arrived in the United States.</p>
<p>My mother and father spent their honeymoon at Andrew&#39;s farm in Lindsborg. I 
am told Otto and Henrietta died also.</p>
<p>I was 17 the first time I saw Andrew. He and I, my dad and John played pitch 
at John&#39;s house how he loved to play. I got tickled about his &quot;Yacks and Yokers.&quot;</p>
<p>Andrew used snuff which he referred to as &quot;SNUZE&quot; (I supposed the 
pronunciation in Sweden- I vividly remember that.)</p>
<p>Andrew, like John, was an excellent blacksmith, and watching him work you 
could really tell he enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Lindsborg, Kan. is called &quot;Little Sweden.&quot; Hilda and Andrew spoke Swedish 
with the home. I am told the children did not learn to speak English until they 
started to school.<br />
Andrew was a very strict disciplinarian (as was my dad). All that was necessary 
was a look to his children. He was also fun loving and played the accordion for 
local dances.</p>
<p>Dates furnished by Marge Shogren, Lindsborg, Kan. granddaughter of Andrew.</p>

<h3>KARL BORGSTROM<br />
OCT. 21, 1875 DEC. 29, 1936</h3>
<p>Karl was the second son born to August and Johanna Anderson. Karl married 
Jenny Anna Sandgren who was born April 14, 1876 in Sweden in . They had a son, 
Karl Oscar, who was born on Oct. 3, 1898 but died a month later on Nov. 6. On 
Aug. 14, 1899, a daughter Astrid was born to them. Karl worked as a smelter in 
Sweden.</p>
<p>In 1901, Karl, Jenny and Astrid came to America. Jenny was pregnant with Karl 
(Holmer) at their crossing.</p>
<p>Karl and Jenny had three sons born in America: Karl (Holmer), Enfred and 
Herbert.</p>
<p>Karl never ventured inland. He worked all his life at the steel mill in 
Roebling. This mill work became a family enterprise and all three sons worked 
there, as well as Jenny&#39;s father, who came to America at age 56 and began 
working there.</p>
<p>Karl kept his nose to the grind stone throughout his life. To my knowledge, 
he never visited any of his brothers. He was never seen by David, Gustav or 
Erik.</p>
<p>In 1920 on their way to Sweden, my dad, Joh and Jessie, Otto and Henrietta, 
Clara and her son stopped and visited Karl&#39;s family.</p>
<p>In 1926, Jenny died. Karl never remarried and died of stomach cancer 10 years 
later in 1936 at the age 61. Karl and Jenny are buried in Roebling, N.J.</p>
<p>I never say karl but from his pictures he looks a great deal like Otto.</p>

<h3>JOHN AUGUST BORGSTOM<br />
SEP. 19, 1866 JUNE 7, 1957</h3>
<p>John Borgstrom came to America in 1897. He first worked in a Blacksmith shop 
in Kansas and then moved to Elk City, Okla. where he met and married Jessie 
Miller (my Mother&#39;s sister in 1903).<br />
He then moved to Oklahoma City in 1906 and continued as a blacksmith for several 
years.</p>
<p>In the early teens he worked as a mechanic with Otto for Page Motor Co.</p>
<p>In 1920, John and Jessie, Otto and Henrietta, Clara and her son Buster and my 
dad returned to Sweden for a visit.</p>
<p>John had a lot of heartache in his life. He and Jessie lost a daughter, Ilda, 
to diphtheria in 1907. Ilda was 1 ½ yrs. old. Also, in the 20&#39;s John developed a 
hip condition and started taking steam baths to help the condition. He went to a 
steam bath and the owner forgot him and left the building. John was hospitalized 
for months and it left him with a stiff hip. In 1930, his wife Jessie had a 
stroke and died.</p>
<p>John and Jessie had four surviving daughters: Charlotte, Alma, Gertrude and 
Flossie.</p>
<p>John was an excellent blacksmith, metal temperer and carpenter and could 
devise almost anything.</p>
<p>John was a very devout Christian. He was the only one of the brothers who 
used no form of tobacco and never would you hear him use any form of curse 
words. I always felt he and my mother were very instrumental in influencing my 
dad.</p>
<p>John invented many things in his life, yet never applied for a patent. Had 
he, there is no doubt in my mind he would have become a very wealthy man. One of 
the things he invented was the locks used on Fruehoff trailers today. There were 
numerous other things such a special tools, etc. All one needed to do was tell 
him what was needed and the &quot;cogs started clicking.&quot; He was quite a remarkable 
man.</p>
<p>When I was a boy, 10 or 12 years of age, he made me a machine gun from a 
block of wood. It had wooden bullets and would shoot across the room some 12 
feet or more. I treasured this but I don&#39;t know what happened to it through the 
years.</p>
<p>In the early 1940&#39;s, he lost his right thumb and first finger on a table saw. 
I remember it well but I don&#39;t know the exact details.</p>
<p>He was employed by the A &amp; B Garage and straightened car frames, did body 
work and made special tools.</p>
<p>After the closing of the A &amp; B Garage, he worked for a commercial trailer 
manufacturing Co. in Oklahoma City building the insulated trailer until his 
retirement.</p>
<p>He had great ingenuity. His right leg and hip were stiff and when he drove a 
car, this leg extended over into the passenger side. He devised an accelerator 
linkage on his 1936 Dodge where he could operate it with his stiff leg.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/accelerator.jpg" width="368" height="120" alt="Accelerator invention by John" /></p>
<p>He could also clutch and brake with his left foot.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/clutch-brake.jpg" width="311" height="75" alt="clutch and brake invention by John" /></p>
<p>He also developed a gadget to tie his show on the right foot. He got the idea 
from bundle knoters on grain binders.<br />
John remarried a lady named Ida in 1936 - everyone feels this was a mistake. 
They never got along. John died of a heart attack in 1957, his wife Ida left 
Oklahoma City and no one ever heard from her again. John is buried in Elk City, 
Okla.</p>

<h2>CHARLOTTE&#39;S SON</h2>
<h3>ALBIN JOHNSON<br />
NOV. 26, 1878</h3>
<p>Little is known about Albin, other than the fact that he was an illegitimate 
son born to Charlotte. He was 5 years old when August married Charlotte.</p>
<p>When August married Charlotte, Andrew was 10 years of age, Carl 8, and John 
6. John being 1 year older than Albin.</p>
<p>Albin landed in America on Feb. 23, 1899 (this is documented). Andrew and 
John were the only two here in America at that time. That year, Tilda was 15, 
Alma 13, Otto 8, Clara 5 and Hjalmar only 2. Obiously, he was not known to the 
rest of the family.</p>
<p>At this point in writing, my comments are based upon &quot;hearsay&quot; and 
speculation. Albin had been working in the wheat harvest in Kansas. He 
supposedly was carrying a large sum of money and &quot;hopped&quot; a freight train bound 
for Kansas City. He was never seen nor heard from again. The exact year this 
occurred is unknown but it was shortly after the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Otto, in later years, hired a private investigator to determine what happened 
to Albin, and I understand spent a large amount of money in the search, but to 
no avail.</p>
<p>Albin was never discussed in family circles and I&#39;m sure there are several 
who never knew he existed.</p>
<h2>THE CHILDREN OF<br />
AUGUST AND CHARLOTTE ANDERSON</h2>
<h3>MATILDA ANDERSON<br />
MARCH 26, 1884 1956</h3>
<p>Matilda (Tilda) was the first born to August and Charlotte. She was very much 
loved and respected by the other family members. They seemed to think of her as 
a &quot;second mother&quot;. She kept them posted on the events in Sweden by 
correspondence. I remember my dad receiving a letter from Tilda. He handed it to 
brother Cole and said, &quot;Do you want to read it?&quot; Cole picked it up and said 
&quot;Dear Al.&quot; No one in Sweden knew dad as &quot;Al.&quot; He got quite a kick out of this. 
Tilda and her family took care of &quot;the old folks&quot; sharing an adjoining cabin.</p>
<p>Tilda married August Johanson on . August was born 1870 and worked as a 
smelter until he became crippled from arthritis and then worked as a gardener 
for the government co-op.</p>
<p>Tilda and August had two sons: Arne and Sven-Erik.</p>
<p>Tilda died 1956 and August in 1945.</p>
<p>Arne and Sven-Erik&#39;s last name is SVARTMARK; the same situation as 
Anderson-Borgstrom.</p>
<p>Sven-Erik told me that Tilda hoped her brothers would come back to see her 
after the war. The post-war years were much better than the 30&#39;s but 
unfortunately for working people, they were still very suppressed. As a result, 
none of the family ever again returned to their homeland another sad and 
disturbing fact in the lives of this family.</p>
<p>Realizing all of this, I cannot express the gratitude I felt when I met 
Sven-Erik at Lindsborg, Kan. in April of 1990 for the first time. This was my 
first touch with relatives from the homeland. It bridged a lifetime gap and 
after I spent the day with him and his wife, I felt I had known them all of my 
life. It was a &quot;Godsend&quot; and I know he feels the same way.</p>

<h3>ALMA ANDERSON<br />
Sept. 29, 1886 1967</h3>
<p>Alma was the second child born to August and Charlotte.</p>
<p>Alma married Otto Nystrom in . Otto was a lumberjack by trade and worked for 
the government co-op.</p>
<p>My dad worked with Otto as teenager and so did David. My dad told me that he 
was cutting wood with Otto and that he became too hot and lay down in a snow 
drift to cool off. As a result, he contacted pneumonia and almost died.</p>
<p>Alma and Otto remained in Sweden and had 10 children in the following order: 
Fritz*, Knute, Lisa, Inga*, Erik*, Majja*, Marta*, Rune, Kajsa, and Sven. Those 
marked with an asterisk are deceased as of this publication date.</p>
<p>I have not seen any of the children and did not know their named until June 
1990. I had wondered about them all my life and of course, my dad never knew all 
of them as there were several births after his visit in 1920.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1989, Myrtle, Mable and Marge went to Sweden for a visit. 
They stayed in the homes of Lisa and Sven-Erik, Knute, Sven and Kajsa came to 
Lisa&#39;s home to see them. Also, Lisa&#39;s daughter and son-in-law Ise and Inge 
Bjornson were there.</p>
<p>Otto born 1885 died 1958.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/family-1.jpg" width="393" height="276" alt="The August Anderson Family Reunion" /></p>
<p>Readers, linger for a while on this page. This had to be the most joyful 
reunion this side of heaven. All family members except Andrew, Carl and Albin 
are here in this picture. John returns home after 23 years. Look at the joyful 
expression on the faces of the boys. David was 14 here, Gustav 16 pictured in 
the back right side.</p>
<p>August, with beard, standing next to Hjalmar and Erik, Tilda and husband, 
August, front left. Immediately right is Uncle Larse (Charlotte&#39;s twin brother), 
next is Otto Nystrom (Alma&#39;s husband), then Clara. What a wonderful day this 
must have been!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was the last time John, Otto, Clara, Hjalmar and Erik 
would ever again see their parents or their homeland. This had troubled me 
greatly through the years. I have been taught there is a &quot;just God.&quot; Surely on 
the other side of the mountain, there had to be a reward and reunion for these 
men and women. At least, I have to think that.</p>

<h3>ANNA ANDERSON<br />
Feb. 23, 1889 Jan. 18, 1898</h3>
<p>Anna was the third child born to August and Charlotte, preceded by Tilda and 
Alma. Anna died of pneumonia Jan. 18, 1898. She was about 9 years old.</p>
<h3>OTTO ANDERSON<br />
Feb. 19, 1891 Nov. 23, 1955</h3>
<p>Otto (Ott) Anderson came to the United States in 1908. I recall him telling 
he had some money sewn inside his coat and on the way over someone discovered it 
and stole it.</p>
<p>Otto was a natural leader (I always thought he would have made a good army 
officer). He also had a good personality and mixed well with the public. As the 
result of these traits, he always wound up with a supervisor&#39;s job.</p>
<p>He married Henrietta Steel in 1915. Henrietta was barren due to having the 
mumps. According to my dad, this could have been corrected through surgery. They 
chose, however, not to have children until they became financially secure. 
Tomorrow never came. It is my opinion that Otto regretted this in later years 
and substituted with great affection for his nieces and nephews. I recall that 
when I was a &quot;tot&quot;, he would jingle coins in his pocket when they came to visit, 
reach in his pocket and give out money to all.</p>
<p>Otto was an avid hunter and fisherman, these being some of his favorite 
things to do.</p>
<p>I remember his having a &quot;crooked finger&quot; which he told me got caught in a 
horse halter rope. This happened at Andrew&#39;s farm where he stayed when he first 
came over.</p>
<p>He enjoyed smoking Roe-Tan Cigars as well as Lucky Strike Cigarettes. He was 
a heavy smoker.</p>
<p>The following is his work history (some dates may not be exact):</p>
<p>In 1908, he came to this country. The first few years are unknown. Otto 
wrestled in Wichita, Kan. for the Light Heavyweight Division during his early 
years here. He did not win but the match was called a draw.</p>
<ul>
	<li>1912-1920&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page Motor Co., Oklahoma City Shop 
	Supervisor</li>
<li>1921-1934&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Co-owner of A&amp;B Garage, Oklahoma City</li>
	<li>1934-1940&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned farm in Bluejacket (managed by David)</li>
<li>1940-1942&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned farm in Minnesota</li>
	<li>1942-1947&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervisor at Tinker AFB</li>
<li>1947-1950&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned farm in Big Cabin, Okla.</li>
<li>1950-death&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned and operated resort in Grove, Okla.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shortly before Otto&#39;s death in 1955, he knew he was dying of cancer of the 
aorta and was concerned for Henrietta&#39;s welfare. He asked each of the brothers 
to look out for her. Ironically, she out lived all of them and died in a rest 
home in 1989 at the age of 97. Otto and Henrietta are buried in Grove.</p>

<h3>CLARA BORGSTROM<br />
April 27, 1894 Jan. 6, 1982</h3>
<p>Clara came to the United States in 1910. She was loved by everyone. She was 
always jolly, a very positive thinker, seemed more broad minded than some of the 
others and had the accent. I remember one of her expressions upon being 
surprised was &quot;oh, de dickens.&quot;</p>
<p>Clara&#39;s first husband was Rupert Wilkerson who made electrical signs and 
lights. He was an electrical genius. Dad used to tell about him &quot;hot wiring&quot; his 
work bench and sending him over to pick up a tool for him. They first lived in 
Oklahoma City and then moved to Denver, Colo. Rupert was a very talented likable 
man, so all that knew him said, but had one problem, he was a thief, which no 
one knew. As the story goes, he was working on some light in a Catholic church 
in Denver and put gum on the locks of the church when he left that afternoon. 
That night he returned and stole gallons of Communion wine (this was during 
Prohibition). The authorities went to his shop at home recovered the wine and 
found numerous other &quot;hot items.&quot; He was imprisoned and then broke out of jail. 
Needless to say, Rupert was not discussed in family circles.</p>
<p>Clara and Rupert had one son named Floyd (Buster) Wilkerson.</p>
<p>Clara divorced Rupert and went to work as a cook for a family in Denver. This 
family (name unknown) was very much into the money. So much so, that they 
sponsored, either in part or completely, the flight of Charles Lindberg. 
Lindberg came to the family home and was met by Clara and Buster.</p>
<p>Clara later married an immigrant from Finland, Victor Holm, who came to the 
United States in 1904. Vic was a lead miner and he and Clara made their home in 
Denver until 1966. They moved to Oceanside, Calif. after Vic&#39;s retirement. Clara 
was an asthmatic and was on medication constantly in Denver. After moving to 
California, she no longer required medication.</p>
<p>From all reports, Clara and Victor had a happy marriage. Victor died in 1968 
of an apparent heart attack. I never saw him. </p>
<p>Clara then married Mike Billet, whom I met after their marriage in 1970. Mike 
died in</p>
<p>Clara was the last of the living children. She died in Oceanside, Calif. on 
Jan. 1982 and is buried there.</p>

<h3>CLIPPING FROM OKLA CITY PAPER 1920</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Newspaper-clipping.jpg" width="173" height="183" alt="Clipping from Oklahoma City in 1920" /></p>
<p>You will note this clipping mentions Mrs. R. G. Seymore. Rupert Wilkerson 
married Clara under the false name of Rupert Seymore. It was some time later 
when she learned the truth and involved quite an amount of legal action to get 
this straightened out.</p>
<p>It is also interesting that when Clara and Otto first came to America they 
stayed at Andrews for a period of time. Clara became quite interested in a young 
man named Koons. Big brother Otto did not like Koons and ran him off. There was 
hard feelings between Clara and Otto over this. Otto on the other hand, became 
quite fond of Rupert and strongly encouraged this relationship Could it be he 
ran the wrong one off?</p>

<h3>HJALMAR BORGSTROM<br />
Jan. 11, 1887 June 4, 1960</h3>
<p>Hjalmar Borgstrom came to the United States in 1914. He was embarrassed by 
his first name in this country inasmuch as no one could pronounce it, let alone 
spell it. Consequently, he adopted the nickname of Al because he did not have a 
middle name. He also took the first two letters of his name H.J. and carried his 
checking account and signed documents as H.J. Borgstrom.</p>
<p>Hjalmar first stop after landing here was at his half-brother Carl&#39;s home. He 
stayed there a short while and then went on to Iowa where he worked on a farm 
for his cousin. He never told me a great deal about this cousin except that he 
treated him badly, taking advantage of him by having him work long hard hours 
with little pay. His cousin had a son in the first grade and Hjalmar studied the 
&quot;Primer&quot; with this son at night. This is how he learned to read the English 
language.</p>
<p>Hjalmar was not a big man standing only 5 feet 7 ½ inches, but he had the 
biggest hands I have ever seen on any man and very broad shoulders. He was 
tremendously strong.</p>
<p>Hjalmar was a &quot;work-aholic.&quot; He use to say, &quot;Hard work never hurt anyone.&quot; 
Ironically, this was the main contribution to his early death. He literally 
worked himself to death.</p>
<p>Hjalmar enlisted in the U.S. Army on 29 AUG 1918 and was sent overseas to 
France. The war ended while he was serving in France and upon his release in 
1919, he went to Oklahoma City, joining and working with hs brother Otto at the 
Page Motor Co.</p>
<p>Hjalmar returned to Sweden, as previously mentioned, in 1920 for a visit and 
upon his return brought brother Erik back with him.</p>
<p>Hjalmar married Ermin Miller on July 2, 1921. Ermin was younger sister of 
Jessie, John&#39;s wife. To them there were born three sons: Cole, Harold and 
Clifford.</p>
<p>In 1921, Hjalmar and Otto formed the A&amp;B Garage in Oklahoma City, employing 
all the brothers except Andrew and Karl. They had a very flourishing business 
until the 1929 crash. My dad told me in 1932 they had over $30,000 in 
uncollected debts. (That was a &quot;hunk&quot; in those days.) He also told me that 
during 1932, he and Otto paid the other boys salaries from their personal 
checking accounts. It literally wiped them out.</p>
<p>In 1933, he bought a farm at Big Cabin, Okla. The next seven years were a 
disaster trying to fight the depression, drought and grasshoppers. Financially, 
things did not get better until World War II and at that time he gave up his two 
older sons to go to war.</p>
<p>Hjalmar loved farming. This is what he always wanted to do. However, he was 
also very skillful with his hands, being an excellent mechanic, blacksmith and 
carpenter.</p>
<p>He was not a highly educated man but was very &quot;street-smart.&quot; He could 
calculate math problems very quickly in his head.</p>
<p>As a young man, like most of his brothers, his temper had a &quot;short-fuse.&quot; 
Over what you have read so far, I think you can understand why.</p>
<p>He was a very strict disciplinarian, tolerating no foolishness. All he had to 
do to get our immediate attention was to look at us.</p>
<p>He was a very devoted family man. The war years were terribly hard on him, 
grieving and worrying for his sons&#39; safety.</p>
<p>In 1940, he received a letter from Tilda saying his dad had died. I remember 
him sitting at the table and he began to cry. This was the first time I ever saw 
my dad cry. I will never forget that but in the years that followed through the 
war and all, I saw it several times thereafter.</p>
<p>Hjalmar became quite active in the Christian Church, serving as an elder the 
last several years of his life, which is very comforting to his family. He would 
say to me as a youth: &quot;You will go to church while living under my roof. If you 
don&#39;t that&#39;s my fault. After you leave, if you don&#39;t that&#39;s your fault.&quot;</p>
<p>He and I had a very close relationship. Much of the information contained 
herein came from our discussions. He had a somewhat dry sense of humor. I 
remember we would be working at a job which was not real desirable and being a 
typical boy, I would start complaining. He would say, &quot;But just think of all the 
fun we are having!&quot; He always got a laugh from me.</p>
<p>Everyone liked and respected Al. If he had an enemy, I don&#39;t know who it was.</p>
<p>In July 1956, he had a heart attack. It was steadily downhill from then until 
his death in 1960. He died a horrible death from &quot;hardening of the arteries&quot; 
which left him unable to walk for the last several months of his life. Also, he 
spent the last few months reverting back to his childhood and not speaking a 
word of English.</p>
<p>Hjalmar died on June 4, 1960. He is buried in Big Cabin. Ermin joined him on 
June 10, 1988.</p>
<p>I have just recently learned that Andrew, like Al, stayed with a cousin, when 
he first arrived in America. I am told that one of Charlotte&#39; brothers came to 
America and was killed in an accident in North Dakota. That is all the 
information I have, but could be an explanation for the cousin in Kansas Andrew 
stayed with and the cousin in Iowa tat Al stayed with.</p>

<h3>Erik Georg BORGSTROM<br />
May 28, 1901 Feb. 11, 1969</h3>
<p>Erik (Erie) came to America in 1920. My dad brought him on his return from a 
visit to Sweden.</p>
<p>Erik was the tallest of the boys standing at 6 feet 1 inch. He had mastered 
the English language and had very little accent. He liked to use big words. I 
remember he quite often quoted, &quot;Now from a biological standpoint&quot;&quot; I always 
thought Erik would have liked to have been a professional person. He liked to 
sip good whiskey and stated he loved girls big ones, little ones, young or old. 
I am in no way implying he was an alcoholic or a womanizer but just that he 
liked them both.</p>
<p>Erik went to a trade school in Sweden and learned electronics. He was quite 
knowledgeable and skilled in that field. He was fun loving and somewhat 
&quot;ornery.&quot; He was also very conservative with his money.</p>
<p>Erik married Bernice Holden in 1922. They had one son, Ronald. According to

<h3>GUSTAV ADOLP ANDERSON<br />
Dec. 26, 1904 Jan. 17, 1981</h3>
<p>Gustav (called Gust, not Gus, by his brothers) came to the United States in 
1922. He was on the same ship with actress Greta Garbo. He was also called by 
his brothers &quot;the power house&quot;. He had amazing brute strength. He would close a 
big machinist vise down and then bend the handle. I can remember at family 
gatherings he would playfully grab one of the brother&#39;s knees in his viselock 
hand and they would start to dance.</p>
<p>Gustav was an excellent machinist, having learned this trade from his 
father-in-law, Johnny Johnson. He could make almost anything on a lathe to 
perfection. He was also an excellent mechanic. As a young man, he played the 
accordion. He laughed a lot and was fun loving and somewhat &quot;ornery.&quot;</p>
<p>Gustav had a dry sense of humor and said several things which the family 
laughed over for years. Here are a few: A salesman came to the A&amp;B Garage and 
tried to sell Gust something as he was working away on a car. The salesman asked 
if he was interested and he replied, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t even think about it!&quot;</p>
<p>Another event in the A&amp;B Garage happened when he had difficulty trying to 
start a customer&#39;s car. Otto asked him if he had tried to crank it. He replied, 
&quot;I cranked it till I boiled the water in the radiator.&quot; He once described a lady 
he had talked to who had loose dentures, as sounding like a typewriter. In 1960, 
he had a heart attack and had stopped smoking. I asked how he was doing and he 
said, &quot;I would like to have a cigarette at least 3 feet long.&quot;</p>
<p>Gustav and Otto were naturalized in this country under the family name of 
Anderson. All of the others were naturalized under the name of Borgstrom which 
was bestowed upon them by the priest of the Lutheran Church after they completed 
their confirmation class. Anderson was a very common name so the priest changed 
their names to Borgstrom. The immigration authorities gave them their choice of 
keeping the name Borgstrom or going back to the family name of Anderson.</p>
<p>Gustav married Kathie Johnson, who was ½ Swedish and ½ German, in September 
1928. They had two children: Frances (Kathie) and Robert.</p>
<p>Gustav, Erik and Otto remained close to each other in geographical area 
throughout their lives. For much of their lives, they did not stay in one place 
long.</p>
<p>The following is a list of Gustav&#39;s work history and area where he lived (the 
dates may not be exact):</p>
<ul>
	<li>1920&#39;s-1933&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&amp;B Garage, 
	Oklahoma City mechanic</li>
<li>1933-1934&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Houston machinist</li>
	<li>1935-1936&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Tacoma, Wash. machinist</li>
<li>1937-1941&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welch, 
Okla. mechanic</li>
	<li>1942-1943&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Chicago tool and die maker</li>
<li>1944-1945&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned 
farm Minnesota</li>
	<li>1945-1947&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Tinker AFB machinist</li>
<li>1948-1950&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned 
farm, Big Cabin</li>
<li>1951-retirement&nbsp;&nbsp; Pryor machinist, John Deere</li>
</ul>
<p>It appeared to me that Gustav, Erik and Otto in the earlier years of their 
lives were searching for something which they didn&#39;t find until the last few 
years of their lives.<br />
Gustav died of a heart attack on Jan. 17, 1981 and is buried in Pryor, Okla.</p>

<h3>DAVID HAROLD BORGSTROM<br />
Feb. 9, 1906 March 29, 1981</h3>
<p>David (Dav, as his brothers called him) came to the United States in October 
of 1923. I recall him telling about going to the delicatessen upon his arrival 
here. He would pick up food in one hand and extend the other hand out with coins 
in it, trusting that people would make correct change. He first went to 
Lindsborg, Kan. and stayed and worked with Andrew, the oldest of the boys.</p>
<p>He once told me that he and Andrew were &quot;batching&quot; in Colorado. They leased 
800 acres in Byers, Colo. from 1923 until 1927. Andrew made a raisin pie but did 
not put any filling in it. He laughed and said it was like B.B.&#39;s.</p>
<p>David was not a big man but like my dad, he was built &quot;like a gorilla.&quot; I 
visited him on his farm in Minnesota in 1950. For fun, he would take the crank 
of his Fordson tractor, spin in and lift the front wheels of the tractoroff the 
ground amazing!</p>
<p>David worked as a mechanic in the A&amp;B Garage from 1927 until 1933. He then 
worked in Austin, Yexas with Gustav and Johnny Johnson in a machine shop for a 
year or so. In 1934, he and his family moved to Bluejacket where he operated a 
farm. In 1940, he moved to Taylor Falls, Minn. where he owned and operated a 
dairy. He remained there until 1977. He then moved to Grove, Okla. to look after 
Henrietta, Otto&#39;s widow, until his death in 1981.</p>
<p>David married Leona Steele on Sept. 15, 1930. They had two sons: Carl and 
Kenneth.</p>
<p>David was like my dad in many ways including appearance. He became a father 
substitute for my two brothers and me.</p>
<p>As a younger man he had a violent temper but this mellowed through the years. 
He was fun loving, laughed a lot and was a positive thinker. He was extremely 
hard working. He was easy to get acquainted with and easy to become attached to. 
He always had a twinkle in his eye. People liked to be around him. He spoke with 
a heavy accent and was very liberal in his thinking.</p>
<p>David died of a heart attack on March 29, 1981 and is buried in Grove, Okla.</p>
<p>David&#39;s wife, Leona, is living in Taylor Falls, Minn.</p>
<p>Dates furnished by Carl Borgstrom, son of David, Pryor, Okla.</p>
<h3>A &amp; B GARAGE</h3>
<p>This photo was made in the flourishing days of the garage 1926. Shown are 
co-owners Otto and Al and Bookkeeper Mrs. Hill.</p>
<p>During these days, Otto and Al drove big cars, owned nice homes, and each had 
a colored maid.</p>
<p>The A &amp; B provided full service: complete motor rebuilding, repair, 
upholstery, body work and storage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately these good times didn&#39;t last long when the &quot;crash&quot; came in 
1929, they continuedto give credit to Doctors, Lawyers, etc., thinking times 
would get better they didn&#39;t!</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>I wish to thank Marge Shogren, Carl Borgstrom, Bob Borgstrom, Kenneth 
Borgstrom, Kathie Anderson, Flossie &amp; Bill Baker, and Sven-Erik Svartmark for 
the dates and data they furnished.</p>
<p>Many hours of work have gone into the preparation of this publication.</p>
<p>I hope that those of you of the third generation do not feel slighted that 
your names have not been mentioned. It is my wish that one of you will &quot;pick up&quot; 
where I have left off.</p>
<p>Some things have been told that some may feel should have been left out. I 
have tried to present the facts and it should be remembered &quot;there are skeletons 
in everyone&#39;s closets.&quot;</p>
<p>Many times, in family gatherings my Dad and his brothers stated what a grand 
and glorious country we live in. Each of them, in their own way, definitely made 
a contribution to America. This was to say, with all the heart-aches and 
suffering they endured. It was worth it and if you have pulled a &quot;tour of duty 
overseas&quot; I think you will agree.</p>
